Cuisine Trends

##Overview

Cuisine Trends seeks to collect data on various types of restaurants in specific
geographic regions, then display aggregate data on number of the business of that
type within the area. Furthermore, it seeks to collect historic data which can then
be used to analyze the trends of different cuisines in various locations. 

Ultimately, the mission is to display this data in a mobile Android app, with
considerations of making it available on web as well. 

##Details

The Yelp API will be used to collect data on businesses and their types. Only 
the count of businesses, their cuisine type, and their general location will be
collected. This data will be aggregated then stored for in private databases
for further analysis/display.

In no way will this aggregate data be used for commercial purposes. For the time
being, only the contributors of this project will have access to this data, but
availability may extend to future users of the planned app only as displayed by
the app.
